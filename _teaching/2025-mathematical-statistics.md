## Think-Pair-Share: What is Statistics? {.center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**ü§î Think (1 minute):**  
In your own words, what does "statistics" mean to you? How do you use it in daily life?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üë• Pair (2 minutes):**  
Share your definition with a neighbor. Find common themes.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üó£Ô∏è Share:**  
Let's hear some definitions before we explore formal ones!

## Definitions of Statistics {.center}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
**Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary:**  
Statistics is "a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data."
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Stuart and Ord (1991):**  
"Statistics is the branch of the scientific method which deals with the data obtained by counting or measuring the properties of populations."
:::

---

## Definitions of Statistics (cont.) {.center}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
**Rice (1995):**  
Statistics is "essentially concerned with procedures for analyzing data, especially data that in some vague sense have a random character."
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Key Insight:**  
All definitions emphasize data and uncertainty!
:::

## Definitions of Statistics (cont.) {.center}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
**Freund and Walpole (1987):**  
Statistics encompasses "the science of basing inferences on observed data and the entire problem of making decisions in the face of uncertainty."
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Mood, Graybill, and Boes (1974):**  
Statistics is "the technology of the scientific method" and is concerned with:
1. The design of experiments and investigations
2. Statistical inference
:::

## The Core Objective {.center}

::: {.callout-important}
**Central Goal of Statistics:**  
The objective of statistics is to make an inference about a population based on information contained in a sample from that population and to provide an associated measure of goodness for the inference.
