## Project Overview

The VS-LTGARCHX (Variable Selection Long-Term Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity with Exogenous variables) project represents a significant advancement in time series econometric modeling.

## Objectives

- Develop enhanced GARCH modeling framework with improved variable selection
- Incorporate long-term memory components for better volatility forecasting
- Create robust implementation for practical financial applications

## Methodology

The research combines:
- Advanced statistical theory for time series analysis
- Machine learning techniques for variable selection
- Extensive empirical validation using financial market data

## Key Results

- Improved forecasting accuracy compared to traditional GARCH models
- Better handling of long-term volatility patterns
- Robust performance across different market conditions

## Implementation

The methodology has been implemented in both R and Python, with comprehensive documentation and examples available for practitioners.
