## Think-Pair-Share: Dice Intuition {.center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üé≤ Scenario:** Rolling two dice...

*Think (30 seconds):* If the first die shows 3, how does this change your expectation for the total?

## Example 1: The Dice Problem

Imagine we are throwing two dice, and each possible outcome has the same chance of happening. So, each outcome has a probability of $\frac{1}{36}$. 

**Question:** We roll the dice, and we see that the first die shows a 3. With this new information, what's the likelihood that the total of the two dice is 8?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**ü§î Quick Poll:** What do you think?
- A) 1/36  
- B) 1/6  
- C) 1/3  
- D) 5/36
:::

---

## Example 1: Building Intuition

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Given information:** First die = 3

**Possible outcomes:** (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**For sum = 8:** We need 3 + ? = 8, so second die must be 5

**Favorable outcome:** Only (3,5)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Solution:** $P(\text{sum}=8|\text{first die}=3) = \frac{1}{6}$
:::

## Definition: Conditional Probability {.center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Conditional probabilities** describe the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Mathematical Definition:**

The conditional probability of event A occurring given event B is:

$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{if } P(B) > 0$$
:::

## Interactive Exercise: Missing Keys {.center}

**Scenario:** Joe's missing key problem

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- 80% certain key is in jacket pockets
- 40% certain it's in left pocket  
- 40% certain it's in right pocket
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üîç Search Result:** Left pocket searched - no key found!

**Question:** What's the probability it's in the right pocket now?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Think-Write-Pair:** Take 2 minutes to work this out with a partner
:::

---

## Example 2: Solution Steps

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Initial probabilities:**
- P(left pocket) = 0.40
- P(right pocket) = 0.40  
- P(elsewhere) = 0.20
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**After unsuccessful left search:**
- P(not in left) = 0.60
- P(right | not in left) = ?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Solution:**
$$P(\text{right}|\text{not left}) = \frac{P(\text{right})}{P(\text{not left})} = \frac{0.40}{0.60} = \frac{2}{3}$$

## Student Activity: Coin Flips {.center}

**Setup:** Flip a coin twice  
**Sample Space:** S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üéØ Your Challenge:** Find these conditional probabilities:

a) P(both heads | first flip is heads)  
b) P(both heads | at least one head)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**‚è±Ô∏è Time:** 3 minutes in small groups
**üìù Show:** Your reasoning process
:::

---

## Example 3: Solutions Revealed

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Part (a):** P(both heads | first flip is heads)

Given first flip is H: Sample space reduces to {(H,H), (H,T)}  
Only (H,H) satisfies "both heads"  
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{2}$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Part (b):** P(both heads | at least one head)  

At least one H: {(H,H), (H,T), (T,H)} - 3 outcomes  
Both heads: {(H,H)} - 1 outcome  
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{3}$
:::

## Key Insight: Subset Principle

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Remark 1:**

If each outcome of a finite sample space S is equally likely, then, conditional on the event that the outcome lies in a subset F ‚äÜ S, all outcomes in F become equally likely.

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**ü§ù Discussion Moment:** How does this principle apply to our coin example?

## Bridge Card Challenge

**Context:** Bridge game with 52 cards dealt to 4 players (13 each)

**Given:** North and South have 8 spades total

**Question:** What's the probability East has exactly 3 of the remaining 5 spades?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üß† Strategy Session:** 
- What type of probability distribution is this?
- What are the key parameters?
:::

---

## Example 4: Bridge Solution

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Problem Analysis:**
- East and West share 26 cards total
- 5 spades and 21 non-spades available
- East gets exactly 13 cards
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Distribution Type:** Hypergeometric!

**Formula:**
$$P(X = 3) = \frac{\binom{5}{3} \times \binom{21}{10}}{\binom{26}{13}}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Solution:** $P(\text{East has 3 spades}) = \frac{5}{13} \approx 0.385$
:::

## Think-Pair-Share: Course Decision

**Celine's Dilemma:**
- French course: P(A grade) = 1/2
- Chemistry course: P(A grade) = 2/3  
- Decision method: Fair coin flip

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**ü§î Think:** What's P(gets A in chemistry)?

**üë• Pair:** Is this the same as P(A | takes chemistry)?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Key Distinction:** Joint probability vs. conditional probability!
:::

---

## Example 5: Course Decision Solution

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Events:**
- C: Takes chemistry
- A: Gets an A grade
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Given:**
- P(C) = 1/2 (fair coin)
- P(A|C) = 2/3
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Solution:**
$$P(\text{A in chemistry}) = P(C) \times P(A|C) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$$
:::

---

## Connection: Multiplication Principle

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Remark 2:** By our definition, we have:

$$P(EF) = P(F)P(E|F)$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**This extends to multiple events!**
:::

---

## The Multiplication Rule {.center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Formula 1:**

$$P(E_1E_2E_3 \cdots E_n) = P(E_1)P(E_2|E_1)P(E_3|E_1E_2) \cdots P(E_n|E_1E_2E_3 \cdots E_{n-1})$$

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üí° Memory Aid:** Chain of conditional probabilities!
:::

---

## Proof: Multiplication Rule

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Proof Strategy:** Telescoping fractions

$$\text{R.H.S.} = P(E_1) \cdot \frac{P(E_1E_2)}{P(E_1)} \cdot \frac{P(E_1E_2E_3)}{P(E_1E_2)} \cdots \frac{P(E_1E_2 \cdots E_n)}{P(E_1E_2 \cdots E_{n-1})}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Cancellation:**
$$= P(E_1E_2E_3 \cdots E_n) = \text{L.H.S.}$$
:::

## Application: Urn Problems

**Setup:** 8 red balls, 4 white balls  
**Process:** Draw 2 balls without replacement

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Scenario 1:** Equal probability selection  
**Scenario 2:** Weighted selection (red weight = r, white weight = w)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üéØ Challenge:** Find P(both red) for each scenario

**‚è±Ô∏è Time:** Work in groups of 3-4 students
:::

---

## Example 6: Urn Solutions

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Scenario 1 (Equal probability):**
$$P(\text{both red}) = \frac{8}{12} \times \frac{7}{11} = \frac{14}{33}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Scenario 2 (Weighted):**
$$P(\text{both red}) = \frac{8r}{8r + 4w} \times \frac{7r}{7r + 4w}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Special case:** When r = w, we get the same result as Scenario 1!
:::

## Advanced Problem: The Matching Problem

**Historical Context:** N people randomly select from their own N hats

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Known Result:**
$$P_N = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**New Question:** What's the probability that exactly k people have matches?

**üß† Extension Challenge:** Can you relate this to conditional probability?

## Card Distribution Challenge

**Problem:** 52 cards divided into 4 piles of 13 each

**Question:** Probability that each pile has exactly 1 ace?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**ü§ù Strategy Discussion:**
- How many ways to distribute the aces?
- What's the total number of ways to divide cards?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Solution Approach:** Multinomial coefficients + conditional probability
:::

---

## Example 8: Card Solution

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Step 1:** Ways to put one ace in each pile
$$\binom{13}{1}^4 = 13^4$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Step 2:** Ways to distribute remaining 48 cards (12 to each pile)
$$\binom{48}{12,12,12,12} = \frac{48!}{(12!)^4}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Step 3:** Total ways to divide 52 cards
$$\binom{52}{13,13,13,13} = \frac{52!}{(13!)^4}$$

## Group Project: Football Tournament

**The 2016 Champions League Scenario:**
- 8 teams in quarterfinals
- 4 strong teams: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, PSG
- 4 weaker teams
- **Question:** P(no strong team plays another strong team)?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**üèÜ Team Challenge:** 
- Form groups of 4
- Each person tackles a different approach
- Compare solutions at the end
:::

---

## Example 9: Tournament Analysis

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Event Definition:**
Let E_i = team i plays a weak team (i = B, M, R, P)

**Target:** P(E_B ‚à© E_M ‚à© E_R ‚à© E_P)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Approach 1 - Sequential:**
$$P = \frac{4}{7} \times \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{8}{35}$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Approach 2 - Combinatorial:**
$$P = \frac{\text{Favorable pairings}}{\text{Total pairings}} = \frac{4!}{\binom{8}{2,2,2,2}/4!} = \frac{8}{35}$$
