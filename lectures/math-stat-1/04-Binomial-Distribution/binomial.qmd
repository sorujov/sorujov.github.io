## 📖 Definition: Binomial Experiment {.larger}

::: {.callout-note}
## <span>📝</span> Definition 1: Binomial Experiment

A **binomial experiment** possesses the following properties:

1. <span style="font-size:1.3em">🔢</span> The experiment consists of a **fixed number**, $n$, of identical trials
2. <span style="font-size:1.3em">⚖️</span> Each trial results in one of two outcomes: **success** ($S$) or **failure** ($F$)
3. <span style="font-size:1.3em">🎯</span> The probability of success $p$ **remains constant** from trial to trial, with $q = (1 - p)$
4. <span style="font-size:1.3em">🔗</span> The trials are **independent** of each other
5. <span style="font-size:1.3em">📊</span> The random variable $Y$ counts the **number of successes** in $n$ trials

::: {.activity-step}
**🧠 Think** (1 minute): Consider the following financial scenario individually:

> "A credit analyst reviews 10 loan applications from different borrowers. Each application is either approved or rejected based on credit scores. Historical data shows a 65% approval rate."
:::

::: {.activity-step}
**👥 Pair** (1 minute): Discuss with your neighbor - does this meet all five binomial experiment properties?

## 📌 Example 1: Credit Risk Management 

::: {.callout-warning}
## <span>💳</span> Example 1

A bank's loan portfolio contains **four independent corporate loans**, each with a historical **5% probability of default** over the next year. The risk manager is interested in $Y$, the number of loans that **will default**. Is this a binomial experiment?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## <span>✅</span> Solution

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Let's verify each property:

- ✅ **Fixed trials**: Four independent loans ($n = 4$)
- ✅ **Two outcomes**: 
  - Success ($S$): loan **defaults**
  - Failure ($F$): loan **does not default**
- ✅ **Constant probability**: $p = P(S) = 0.05$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- ✅ **Independence**: Loans are from different sectors/independent
- ✅ **Count successes**: $Y$ = number of defaults

**Conclusion**: Yes, this is a binomial experiment! The bank can use binomial distribution to assess portfolio risk.

## 📌 Example 2: Market Survey {.larger}

::: {.callout-warning}
## <span>📊</span> Example 2

An economist surveys **10 randomly selected consumers** from a large population where **40% prefer brand A** over competitors. Let $Y$ be the number who prefer brand A. Does this meet binomial requirements?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## <span>💡</span> Important Remark

When sampling **without replacement** from a finite population, trials are technically dependent. However:

**Rule of Thumb**: If the sample size is less than **5% of the population** ($n < 0.05N$), the dependency is negligible and we can approximate with the binomial distribution.

For large consumer markets, this condition is easily satisfied!

## 🧮 The Binomial Distribution {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
## <span>📝</span> Definition 2: Binomial Distribution

A random variable $Y$ has a **binomial distribution** based on $n$ trials with success probability $p$ if and only if:

$$
p(y) = \binom{n}{y}p^yq^{n-y}, \quad y=0,1,2,\dotsc, n \quad \text{and} \quad 0\le p \le 1
$$

where $q = 1 - p$ and $\binom{n}{y} = \frac{n!}{y!(n-y)!}$

**Notation**: We write $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$ or $Y \sim B(n, p)$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
## <span>💡</span> Binomial Theorem

$$
(q+p)^n = \binom{n}{0}q^n+\binom{n}{1}pq^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}p^2q^{n-2}+\cdots+\binom{n}{n}p^n
$$

Since $p + q = 1$, we have $(q+p)^n = 1$, confirming that $\sum_{y=0}^{n}p(y) = 1$ ✓

## 📌 Example 3: Investment Portfolio {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning}
## <span>💼</span> Example 3

A venture capital fund invests in **5 startup companies**. Historical data shows that **5% of startups fail** within the first year. Find the probability that **at least one startup fails**.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## <span>🔢</span> Solution

Let $Y$ = number of failed startups. Then $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n=5, p=0.05)$.

$$
P(\text{at least one fails}) = 1 - P(Y = 0)
$$

$$
P(Y = 0) = \binom{5}{0}(0.05)^0(0.95)^5 = 1 \times 1 \times (0.95)^5 = 0.774
$$

Therefore:
$$
P(Y \geq 1) = 1 - 0.774 = 0.226
$$

::: {.key-concept}
**Interpretation**: There's a **22.6% chance** that at least one startup will fail, despite the individual failure rate being only 5%. This demonstrates the importance of diversification!

## 📌 Example 4: Pharmaceutical Investment {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning}
## <span>💊</span> Example 4

A pharmaceutical company knows that **30% of experimental drugs** pass clinical trials without their new technology. They claim a new screening method increases success. With the new method, **9 out of 10 drugs passed trials**. If the method were **worthless**, what's $P(Y \geq 9)$?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## <span>📊</span> Solution Setup

Let $Y$ = number of drugs passing trials. If method is **worthless**: $p = 0.3$, $n = 10$.

We need to find $P(Y \geq 9) = P(Y = 9) + P(Y = 10)$
:::

## 📌 Example 4: Solution {.smaller}

Probability of exactly **nine successes**:

$$
P(Y = 9) = \binom{10}{9} (0.3)^9 (0.7)^1 = 10 \times (0.3)^9 \times 0.7 = 0.000138
$$

. . .

Probability of exactly **ten successes**:

$$
P(Y = 10) = \binom{10}{10} (0.3)^{10} (0.7)^0 = (0.3)^{10} = 0.000006
$$

. . .

Therefore:
$$
P(Y \geq 9) = 0.000138 + 0.000006 = 0.000144
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## <span>🎯</span> Statistical Interpretation
If the screening method is **ineffective**, observing 9+ successes has probability **0.0144%** (about 1 in 7,000!). This provides **very strong evidence** that the new screening method is effective. A pharmaceutical company would likely invest in this technology based on such results.
:::

## 📝 Quiz #2: Calculating Probabilities {.quiz-question}

An investor makes 6 independent trades with 50% probability of profit on each. What is the probability of exactly 4 profitable trades?

**Hint**: Use $n=6$, $p=0.5$, $y=4$ in the binomial formula.

- [0.234]{.correct data-explanation="✅ Correct! Using the binomial formula: P(Y=4) = C(6,4) × (0.5)^4 × (0.5)^2 = 15 × 0.0625 = 0.234 or about 23.4%. This means there's roughly a 1 in 4 chance of getting exactly 4 profitable trades out of 6."}
- 0.313
- 0.156
- 0.500

## 📌 Example 5: Using Statistical Tables {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning}
## <span>📋</span> Example 5

A bond portfolio contains bonds with **5% default probability**. If the fund holds **20 bonds**, find the probability that **at least four bonds default**.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## <span>🔢</span> Solution

With $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n=20, p=0.05)$:

$$
P(Y\geq 4) = 1 - P(Y\leq 3) = 1 - \sum_{y=0}^3p(y)
$$

We can calculate each term or use cumulative binomial tables. Using statistical software or tables:

$P(Y \leq 3) \approx 0.9841$

Therefore: 
$$
P(Y \geq 4) = 1 - 0.9841 = 0.0159
$$

**Risk Assessment**: Only about **1.6% chance** of having 4+ defaults, suggesting the portfolio is relatively safe under current assumptions.
:::

## 📊 Using Binomial Tables

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"} 
::: {.callout-tip}
## <span>📚</span> Cumulative Binomial Tables

Tabulated values represent **cumulative probabilities**:
$$
P(Y \leq a) = \sum_{y=0}^{a}p(y)
$$

**Steps for** $n=20$, $p=0.05$, finding $P(Y \leq 3)$:

1. <span style="font-size:1.2em">➊</span> Locate the section for $n=20$
2. <span style="font-size:1.2em">➋</span> Find the column for $p=0.05$
3. <span style="font-size:1.2em">➌</span> Read the cumulative probability at row $y=3$
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.key-concept}
**Modern Approach**: Use statistical software for exact calculations:

- **R**: `pbinom(3, 20, 0.05)` gives $P(Y \leq 3)$

- **Python**: `scipy.stats.binom.cdf(3, 20, 0.05)`

- **Excel**: `=BINOM.DIST(3, 20, 0.05, TRUE)`

$$
\mu = E(Y) = np
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = V(Y) = npq = np(1-p)
$$

$$
\sigma = SD(Y) = \sqrt{npq}
$$

where $q = 1 - p$.

## 📌 Example 6: Market Research {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning}
## <span>📊</span> Example 6

A market research firm surveys **20 randomly selected consumers** about a new product. **6 respondents** expressed interest in purchasing. Estimate $p$, the true proportion of the population interested in the product.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## <span>🔍</span> Solution: Maximum Likelihood Approach

- Let $Y$ = number interested in product (observed $Y = 6$)
- $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n=20, p=?)$
- Likelihood of observing $Y=6$:

$$
L(p) = P(Y = 6 | p) = \binom{20}{6} p^6 (1 - p)^{14}
$$

**Question**: What value of $p$ **maximizes** this likelihood?
:::

## 🎓 Maximum Likelihood Estimation {.smaller}

To maximize $L(p) = \binom{20}{6} p^6 (1 - p)^{14}$:

::: {.incremental}
- <span style="font-size:1.2em">🎯</span> $\binom{20}{6}$ is constant relative to $p$
- <span style="font-size:1.2em">📈</span> Since $\ln(x)$ is strictly increasing, maximize log-likelihood instead:
:::

. . .

$$
\ln L(p) = \ln\binom{20}{6} + 6\ln(p) + 14\ln(1-p)
$$

. . .

**Differentiate** with respect to $p$:

$$
\frac{d\ln L}{dp} = \frac{6}{p} - \frac{14}{1-p}
$$

## 🔍 Finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimate {.smaller}

Set the derivative equal to zero:

$$
\frac{6}{p} - \frac{14}{1-p} = 0
$$

. . .

Multiply both sides by $p(1-p)$:

$$
6(1-p) - 14p = 0
$$

$$
6 - 6p - 14p = 0
$$

$$
6 = 20p
$$

$$
p = \frac{6}{20} = 0.3
$$

## ✅ Solution Verification {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
## <span>✓</span> Final Solution

Check the **second derivative**:
$$
\frac{d^2\ln L}{dp^2} = -\frac{6}{p^2} - \frac{14}{(1-p)^2}
$$

This is **always negative** for $0 < p < 1$, confirming a maximum at $p = 6/20$.

**Maximum Likelihood Estimate**:
$$
\boxed{\hat{p} = \frac{6}{20} = 0.30 = 30\%}
$$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## <span>🎯</span> General Result

For binomial data, the **Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)** is always:
$$
\hat{p} = \frac{Y}{n} = \frac{\text{number of successes}}{\text{number of trials}}
$$

This is simply the **sample proportion** - intuitive and optimal!
