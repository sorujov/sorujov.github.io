## Think-Pair-Share: Random Events {.center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**🤔 Think (1-2 minutes):**

Consider events that occur randomly over time or space. Can you think of three examples from your daily life where events happen with some average rate but at unpredictable times?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**👥 Pair (2-3 minutes):**

Share your examples with a partner. Discuss:

- What makes these events "random"?
- Can you estimate the average rate of occurrence?
- Are the events independent of each other?

**🗣️ Share:**

Let's hear a few examples from the class and discuss how they relate to today's topic.

# The Poisson Probability Distribution

## Definition and Motivation {.center}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition

The **Poisson probability distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events that occur within a **fixed interval of time** or space, given a known average rate of occurrence. It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Description

Split up the time period into \(n\) subintervals so that:

- P(one event happens in a subinterval) = \(p\),
- P(no event happens in a subinterval) = \(1-p\),
- P(more than one event happens in a subinterval) = 0
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Remark

Then the total number of events in the given time interval is just the total number of subintervals that contain one event.
:::
:::

## Derivation from Binomial Distribution {.center}

Letting \(\lambda = np\) and taking the limit of the binomial probability

\[
p(y) = \binom{n}{y} p^y(1 - p)^{n-y}
\]

as \(n \to \infty\), we have

::: {.fragment}
\[
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \binom{n}{y} p^y(1 - p)^{n-y} &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n(n - 1) \cdots (n - y + 1)}{y!} \left( \frac{\lambda}{n} \right)^y \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n-y}
\end{align}
\]
:::

## Derivation (continued) {.center}

::: {.fragment}
\[
\begin{align}
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n} \frac{n(n - 1) \cdots (n - y + 1)}{n^y} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{-y}
\end{align}
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
\[
\begin{align}
&= \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n} \cdot \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{-y} \cdot \lim_{n\to \infty}\left((1-\frac{1}{n}) \cdots (1 - \frac{y-1}{n})\right)
\end{align}
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
\[
= \boxed{\frac{\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\lambda}}
\]
:::

## Formal Definition {.center}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition

A random variable \(Y\) is said to have a **Poisson distribution** if and only if

\[
p(y) = \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\lambda}, \quad y = 0,1,2,\ldots,\quad \lambda > 0
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example

Show that the probabilities assigned by the Poisson probability distribution satisfy the requirements that \(0 \leq p(y) \leq 1\) for all \(y\) and

\[
\sum_{y}p(y) = 1
\]
:::
:::

## Proof of Validity {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Proof

::: {.fragment}
Because \(\lambda > 0\), it is obvious that \(p(y) > 0\) for \(y = 0, 1, 2, \ldots\), and that \(p(y) = 0\) otherwise.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Further,

\[
\sum_{y=0}^{\infty} p(y) = \sum_{y=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\lambda} = e^{-\lambda} \sum_{y=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^y}{y!} = e^{-\lambda} e^{\lambda} = 1
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
because the infinite sum \(\sum_{y=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^y}{y!}\) is a series expansion of \(e^\lambda\).
:::
:::

## ⚡ Quick Check {.center}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Question

Before we move to applications, can you identify:

1. What parameter characterizes the Poisson distribution?
2. What does this parameter represent?
3. What values can \(Y\) take in a Poisson distribution?
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Answers

1. The parameter \(\lambda\) (lambda)
2. It represents the **average rate** of events in the given interval
3. \(Y\) can be \(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\) (any non-negative integer)
:::
:::

# Applications and Examples

## Example 1: Police Patrol {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example

Suppose that a random system of police patrol is devised so that a patrol officer may visit a given beat location \(Y = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\) times per half-hour period, with each location being visited an average of once per time period. Assume that \(Y\) possesses, approximately, a Poisson probability distribution.

Calculate the probability that the patrol officer will:

- Miss a given location during a half-hour period
- Visit once
- Visit twice
- Visit at least once
:::

## Solution: Police Patrol (Part 1) {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

::: {.fragment}
For this example, the time period is a half-hour, and the mean number of visits per half-hour interval is \(\lambda = 1\). Then

\[
p(y) = \frac{e^{-1}}{y!}, \quad y = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
The event that a given location is **missed** in a half-hour period corresponds to \(Y = 0\), and

\[
P(Y = 0) = p(0) = \frac{e^{-1}}{0!} = e^{-1} \approx 0.368
\]
:::
:::

## Solution: Police Patrol (Part 2) {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution (continued)

::: {.fragment}
Similarly,

\[
p(1) = \frac{e^{-1}}{1!} = e^{-1} \approx 0.368
\]

and

\[
p(2) = \frac{e^{-1}}{2!} = \frac{e^{-1}}{2} \approx 0.184
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
The probability that the location is visited **at least once** is the event \(P(Y \geq 1)\). Then

\[
P(Y \geq 1) = \sum_{y=1}^{\infty} p(y) = 1 - p(0) = 1 - e^{-1} \approx 0.632
\]
:::
:::

## Example 2: Tree Seedlings {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example

A certain type of tree has seedlings randomly dispersed in a large area, with the mean density of seedlings being approximately **five per square yard**. If a forester randomly locates ten 1-square-yard sampling regions in the area, find the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings.
:::

## Solution: Tree Seedlings {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

::: {.fragment}
\(Y\), the number of seedlings per square yard, can be modeled as a Poisson random variable with \(\lambda = 5\). Thus,

\[
P(Y = 0) = p(0) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^0}{0!} = e^{-5} \approx 0.006738
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
The probability that \(Y = 0\) on **ten independently selected regions** is

\[
(e^{-5})^{10}
\]

because the probability of the intersection of independent events is equal to the product of the respective probabilities. The resulting probability is **extremely small**.
:::
:::

## 🌍 Real-World Connection {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Applications in Nature and Society

The Poisson distribution appears in many contexts:

- **Ecology:** Distribution of organisms in space
- **Quality Control:** Number of defects in manufacturing
- **Telecommunications:** Number of calls arriving at a call center
- **Healthcare:** Number of patients arriving at an emergency room
- **Physics:** Radioactive decay events
- **Traffic Engineering:** Number of vehicles passing a point
:::

# Poisson Approximation to Binomial

## When to Use Poisson Approximation {.center}

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Approximation Conditions

The Poisson distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution when:

- \(n\) is **large** (typically \(n \geq 20\))
- \(p\) is **small** (typically \(p \leq 0.05\))
- \(\lambda = np\) is **moderate** (typically \(\lambda \leq 10\))
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Why It Works

When these conditions hold, the binomial distribution with parameters \(n\) and \(p\) is approximately Poisson with parameter \(\lambda = np\).
:::
:::

## Example 3: Binomial Approximation {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example

Suppose that \(Y\) possesses a binomial distribution with \(n = 20\) and \(p = 0.1\). Find the exact value of \(P(Y \leq 3)\) using the table of binomial probabilities, Table: "Binomial Distribution Histograms". Use the following table, to approximate this probability, using a corresponding probability given by the Poisson distribution. Compare the exact and approximate values for \(P(Y \leq 3)\).

## Reference Tool

[Poisson Distribution Applet](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/pois.html)
:::
:::

## Solution: Approximation Comparison {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

::: {.fragment}
**Exact Binomial Calculation:**

According to Table, the exact value of \(P(Y \leq 3) = 0.867\).
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Poisson Approximation:**

If \(W\) is a Poisson-distributed random variable with \(\lambda = np = 20 \times 0.1 = 2\), previous discussions indicate that \(P(Y \leq 3)\) is approximately equal to \(P(W \leq 3)\). Table 3, Appendix 3, gives

\[
P(W \leq 3) = 0.857
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Comparison:** The Poisson approximation is quite good, yielding a value that differs from the exact value by only **0.01** (about 1% relative error).

# Mean and Variance

## Theorem: Expected Value and Variance {.center}

::: {.callout-important}
## Theorem

If \(Y\) is a random variable possessing a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda\), then

\[
\mu = E(Y) = \lambda \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma^2 = V(Y) = \lambda
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Key Insight

In the Poisson distribution, the **mean equals the variance**. This is a unique property that distinguishes it from other distributions!

- Standard deviation: \(\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}\)
- This relationship simplifies many calculations
:::
:::

## Example 4: Industrial Accidents {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example

Industrial accidents occur according to a Poisson process with an average of **three accidents per month**. During the last two months, **ten accidents** occurred.

**Questions:**

- Does this number seem highly improbable if the mean number of accidents per month, \(\mu\), is still equal to 3?
- Does it indicate an increase in the mean number of accidents per month?
:::

## Solution: Industrial Accidents {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

::: {.fragment}
The number of accidents in two months, \(Y\), has a Poisson probability distribution with mean \(\lambda = 2 \times 3 = 6\). The probability that \(Y\) is as large as 10 is

\[
P(Y \geq 10) = \sum_{y=10}^{\infty} \frac{6^y e^{-6}}{y!}
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
By Poisson Distribution Applet or from the theorem:

\[
\mu = \lambda = 6, \quad \sigma^2 = \lambda = 6, \quad \sigma = \sqrt{6} = 2.45
\]
:::
:::

## Solution: Statistical Interpretation {.center}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution (continued)

::: {.fragment}
**The empirical rule** tells us that we should expect \(Y\) to take values in the interval \(\mu \pm 2\sigma\) with a high probability.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Notice that:

\[
\mu + 2\sigma = 6 + (2)(2.45) = 10.90
\]
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Interpretation:** The observed number of accidents, \(Y = 10\), does **not** lie more than \(2\sigma\) from \(\mu\), but it is **close to the boundary**. Thus, the observed result is not highly improbable, but it may be **sufficiently improbable to warrant an investigation**.
:::
:::

## Think-Pair-Share: Decision Making {.center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**🤔 Think (2 minutes):**

You are the safety manager. Based on the analysis showing 10 accidents in 2 months (close to the \(\mu + 2\sigma\) boundary), would you:

- Conclude this is just random variation?
- Investigate potential safety issues?
- Set a new monitoring threshold?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**👥 Pair (3 minutes):**

Discuss with your partner:

- What additional information would you want?
- At what threshold would you definitely investigate?
- How would you communicate this to management?
