# The Binomial Probability Distribution

## Definition: Binomial Experiment {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition 1
A **binomial experiment** possesses the following properties:

1. The experiment consists of a **fixed number**, \(n\), of identical trials.
2. Each trial results in one of two outcomes: **success**, \(S\), or **failure**, \(F\).
3. The probability of success on a single trial is equal to some value \(p\) and **remains the same** from trial to trial. The probability of a failure is equal to \(q = (1 - p)\).
4. The trials are **independent**.
5. The random variable of interest is \(Y\), the **number of successes** observed during the \(n\) trials.

## Example 1: Radar Detection System {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Example 1
An early-warning detection system for aircraft consists of **four identical radar units** operating independently of one another. Suppose that each has a probability of **0.95** of detecting an intruding aircraft. When an intruding aircraft enters the scene, the random variable of interest is \(Y\), the number of radar units that **do not detect** the plane. Is this a binomial experiment?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Solution

Let's verify each property:

- ✅ The experiment involves **four identical trials** (four radar units).
- ✅ Each trial results in one of two outcomes:
  - \(S\) denotes that the aircraft was **not detected**
  - \(F\) denotes that it **was detected**
- ✅ \(p = P(S) = P(\text{do not detect}) = 0.05\)
- ✅ The trials are **independent** because the units operate independently.
- ✅ The random variable of interest is \(Y\), the number of successes in four trials.

**Conclusion**: Yes, this is a binomial experiment!

## Example 2: Voter Preference {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Example 2
Suppose that **40%** of a large population of registered voters favor candidate Jones. A random sample of \(n = 10\) voters will be selected, and \(Y\), the number favoring Jones, is to be observed. Does this experiment meet the requirements of a binomial experiment?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Remark 1
In general, if the population is **large** and the sample size is **relatively small**, the conditional probability of success on a later trial given the number of successes on the previous trials will stay approximately the same regardless of the outcomes on previous trials.

**Key principle**: For sampling without replacement, if \(n < 0.05N\) (sample size is less than 5% of population), we can approximate with binomial distribution.

# The Binomial Probability Formula

## The Binomial Distribution {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Definition 2
A random variable \(Y\) is said to have a **binomial distribution** based on \(n\) trials with success probability \(p\) if and only if 

\[
p(y) = \binom{n}{y}p^yq^{n-y}, \quad y=0,1,2,\dotsc, n \quad \text{and} \quad 0\le p \le 1.
\]

where \(q = 1 - p\) and \(\binom{n}{y} = \frac{n!}{y!(n-y)!}\)
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Formula 1: Binomial Theorem
\[
(q+p)^n = \binom{n}{0}q^n+\binom{n}{1}pq^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}p^2q^{n-2}+\cdots+\binom{n}{n}p^n
\]

Since \(p + q = 1\), we have \((q+p)^n = 1\), which confirms that \(\sum_{y=0}^{n}p(y) = 1\).

## Example 3: Defective Fuses {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Example 3
Suppose that a lot of **5000 electrical fuses** contains **5% defectives**. If a sample of **5 fuses** is tested, find the probability of observing **at least one defective**.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Solution

Let \(Y\) = number of defectives in the sample. Then \(Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n=5, p=0.05)\).

\[
P(\text{at least one defective}) = 1 - P(Y = 0)
\]

\[
P(Y = 0) = \binom{5}{0}(0.05)^0(0.95)^5 = 1 \times 1 \times (0.95)^5 = 0.774
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(Y \geq 1) = 1 - 0.774 = 0.226
\]

**Interpretation**: There is a **22.6% chance** of seeing at least one defective, even though the sample is quite small.
:::

## Example 4: Medical Treatment {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Example 4
Experience has shown that **30%** of all persons afflicted by a certain illness recover. A drug company has developed a new medication. **Ten people** with the illness were selected at random and received the medication; **nine recovered** shortly thereafter. Suppose that the medication was absolutely worthless. What is the probability that at least nine of ten receiving the medication will recover?
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Solution Setup

Let \(Y\) denote the number of people who recover. If the medication is **worthless**, the probability that a single ill person will recover is \(p = 0.3\).

Then the number of trials is \(n = 10\) and we need to find \(P(Y \geq 9)\).
:::

## Example 4: Solution {.smaller}

The probability of exactly **nine recoveries** is:

\[
P(Y = 9) = \binom{10}{9} (0.3)^9 (0.7)^1 = 10 \times (0.3)^9 \times 0.7 = 0.000138
\]

. . .

Similarly, the probability of exactly **ten recoveries** is:

\[
P(Y = 10) = \binom{10}{10} (0.3)^{10} (0.7)^0 = 1 \times (0.3)^{10} = 0.000006
\]

. . .

Therefore:

\[
P(Y \geq 9) = P(Y = 9) + P(Y = 10) = 0.000138 + 0.000006 = 0.000144
\]

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Interpretation
If the medication is **ineffective**, the probability of observing at least nine recoveries is **extremely small** (0.0144%). This provides strong evidence that the medication is actually effective!
:::

## Example 5: Using Tables {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Example 5
The large lot of electrical fuses is supposed to contain only **5% defectives**. If \(n = 20\) fuses are randomly sampled from this lot, find the probability that **at least four defectives** will be observed.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Solution

Letting \(Y\) denote the number of defectives in the sample, we assume the binomial model for \(Y\), with \(p = 0.05\). Thus,

\[
P(Y\geq 4) = 1 - P(Y\leq 3)
\]

and

\[
P(Y\leq 3) = \sum_{y=0}^3p(y) = p(0) + p(1) + p(2) + p(3)
\]

We can use **binomial probability tables** or statistical software to find this cumulative probability.
:::

## Using Binomial Tables

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Table Format
Tabulated values represent cumulative probabilities:
\[
P(Y \leq a) = \sum_{y=0}^{a}p(y)
\]

For our example with \(n=20\) and \(p=0.05\):
- Look up the row for \(n=20\)
- Find the column for \(p=0.05\)
- Read the value for \(a=3\)

From standard tables: \(P(Y \leq 3) \approx 0.9841\)

Therefore: \(P(Y \geq 4) = 1 - 0.9841 = 0.0159\)
:::

**Modern approach**: Use R, Python, or Excel for exact calculations!

# Mean and Variance of Binomial Distribution

## Key Theorem {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem 1
Let \(Y\) be a binomial random variable based on \(n\) trials and success probability \(p\). Then:

\[
\mu = E(Y) = np
\]

\[
\sigma^2 = V(Y) = npq = np(1-p)
\]

where \(q = 1 - p\).
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Intuition
- **Expected value**: If we repeat the experiment many times with \(n\) trials each, on average we expect \(np\) successes per experiment.
- **Variance**: Measures the spread of the distribution. Maximum variance occurs when \(p = 0.5\).

2. If she takes 100 shots, what's the expected number? (1 min)
3. Does the success rate \(p\) change? Why does \(E(Y)\) increase? (2 min)
4. Present your insights (1 min per group)

## Example 6: Employee Survey {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Example 6
Suppose that we survey **20 individuals** working for a large company and ask each whether they favor implementation of a new policy regarding retirement funding. If, in our sample, **6 favored** the new policy, find an estimate for \(p\), the true but unknown proportion of employees that favor the new policy.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Solution: Setup

- Let \(Y\) denotes the number among the 20 who favor the new policy.
- Then \(Y\) has a binomial distribution with \(n = 20\) for some value of \(p\).
- Whatever the true value for \(p\), we conclude that the probability of observing 6 out of 20 in favor of the policy is:

\[
P(Y = 6) = \binom{20}{6} p^6 (1 - p)^{14}
\]

**Question**: How do we find the value of \(p\) that maximizes \(P(Y = 6)\)?
:::

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- We want to find the value of \(p\) that **maximizes** the probability of what we observed.
- \(\binom{20}{6}\) is a constant (relative to \(p\)).
- \(\ln(x)\) is an **increasing function** of \(x\).
- So the value of \(p\) that maximizes \(P(Y = 6) = \binom{20}{6} p^6 (1 - p)^{14}\) is the same as the value of \(p\) that maximizes:
:::

. . .

\[
\ln[p^6(1 - p)^{14}] = 6 \ln(p) + 14 \ln(1 - p)
\]

. . .

**Differentiate** with respect to \(p\):

\[
\frac{d[6 \ln(p) + 14 \ln(1 - p)]}{dp} = \frac{6}{p} - \frac{14}{1 - p}
\]

## Finding the Maximum {.smaller}

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
\frac{6}{p} - \frac{14}{1 - p} = 0
\]

. . .

Multiply both sides by \(p(1-p)\):

\[
6(1-p) - 14p = 0
\]

\[
6 - 6p - 14p = 0
\]

\[
6 = 20p
\]

\[
p = \frac{6}{20} = 0.3
\]

## Solution Verification {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Final Solution

- The **second derivative** of \(6 \ln(p) + 14 \ln(1 - p)\) is:
  \[
  \frac{d^2}{dp^2} = -\frac{6}{p^2} - \frac{14}{(1-p)^2}
  \]

- This is **negative** when \(p = 6/20\), confirming a maximum.

- Hence our estimate for \(p\), based on 6 "successes" in 20 trials, is:

  \[
  \boxed{\hat{p} = \frac{6}{20} = 0.30 = 30\%}
  \]
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Key Insight
The **Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)** for \(p\) in a binomial distribution is simply the sample proportion: \(\hat{p} = \frac{Y}{n}\)

## Summary {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Key Takeaways

**Binomial Experiment Properties:**
1. Fixed number of trials \(n\)
2. Two outcomes: success or failure
3. Constant probability \(p\)
4. Independent trials
5. Count of successes \(Y\)

**Binomial Distribution:**
\[
p(y) = \binom{n}{y}p^yq^{n-y}, \quad y=0,1,2,\dotsc, n
\]

**Mean and Variance:**
\[
E(Y) = np, \quad V(Y) = npq
\]

**Maximum Likelihood Estimate:**
\[
\hat{p} = \frac{Y}{n}
\]

## Homework Problems

1. **Quality Control**: A shipment of 1000 computer chips contains 5% defectives. If 10 chips are randomly selected, what is the probability that at most 2 are defective?

2. **Medical Testing**: A diagnostic test correctly identifies a disease 90% of the time. If 15 patients with the disease are tested, what is the expected number of correct identifications? What is the standard deviation?

3. **Marketing**: Historical data shows that 35% of customers make a purchase after viewing an online ad. If 20 customers view the ad today:
   - What is the probability that exactly 7 make a purchase?
   - What is the probability that at least 5 make a purchase?
   - If you observed 12 purchases, would you suspect the ad's effectiveness has changed?
