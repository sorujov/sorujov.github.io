## 📖 Definition: Statistical Independence {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Definition 1: Independence of Random Variables

Random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if and only if their joint distribution factors into the product of marginal distributions:

**For discrete random variables:**
$$p(x, y) = p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y) \text{ for all } x, y$$

**For continuous random variables:**
$$f(x, y) = f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y) \text{ for all } x, y$$

**Equivalent condition:** For any events $A$ and $B$:
$$P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P(X \in A) \cdot P(Y \in B)$$

**Practical interpretation:** Knowledge of one variable provides **no information** about the other variable.
:::

**Financial Context:** Independence is rare in finance but highly valuable—independent assets provide maximum diversification benefits since they don't move together [web:33][web:36].

## 🔍 Testing for Independence

::: {.callout-tip}
## 📊 How to Test Independence

**Method 1: Check factorization**
- Compute $p(x,y)$ or $f(x,y)$
- Compute $p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y)$ or $f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y)$
- If equal for **all** $(x,y)$, variables are independent

**Method 2: Check conditional equals marginal**
- If $p_{Y|X}(y|x) = p_Y(y)$ for all $x, y$, then independent
- Conditioning on $X$ doesn't change the distribution of $Y$

**Method 3: Check covariance (necessary but not sufficient)**
- If $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$, variables are **uncorrelated**
- Independence ⟹ uncorrelated, but uncorrelated ⏸ independence
- Exception: For jointly normal variables, uncorrelated ⟺ independent
:::

**Important:** Most financial assets are **NOT** independent—they're correlated through common market factors, economic conditions, and behavioral patterns [web:35][web:37].

## 📌 Example 1: Testing Independence {.smaller}

**Problem:** Consider two stocks with the following joint probability distribution:

|   | $Y = -5\%$ | $Y = 0\%$ | $Y = +5\%$ |
|---|------------|-----------|------------|
| $X = -5\%$ | 0.12 | 0.18 | 0.06 |
| $X = 0\%$ | 0.08 | 0.12 | 0.04 |
| $X = +5\%$ | 0.04 | 0.06 | 0.30 |

Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

**Solution:**

First, compute marginal distributions:

$$p_X(-5\%) = 0.12 + 0.18 + 0.06 = 0.36$$
$$p_X(0\%) = 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.24$$
$$p_X(+5\%) = 0.04 + 0.06 + 0.30 = 0.40$$

$$p_Y(-5\%) = 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.04 = 0.24$$
$$p_Y(0\%) = 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.36$$
$$p_Y(+5\%) = 0.06 + 0.04 + 0.30 = 0.40$$

## 📌 Example 1: Solution (continued) {.smaller}

**Test independence at one point:**

Check if $p(-5\%, -5\%) = p_X(-5\%) \cdot p_Y(-5\%)$:

$$p(-5\%, -5\%) = 0.12$$
$$p_X(-5\%) \cdot p_Y(-5\%) = 0.36 \times 0.24 = 0.0864$$

Since $0.12 \neq 0.0864$, the variables are **NOT independent**.

**Financial Interpretation:** The stocks are dependent—their returns are correlated. When we observe Stock $X$'s return, it gives us information about Stock $Y$'s likely return. This reduces diversification benefits compared to truly independent assets.

**Verification:** We can also check:
$$p(+5\%, +5\%) = 0.30 \text{ but } p_X(+5\%) \cdot p_Y(+5\%) = 0.40 \times 0.40 = 0.16$$

The actual probability of both stocks gaining 5% (0.30) is much higher than what independence would predict (0.16), indicating **positive dependence**—the stocks tend to move together.

## 📖 Definition: Expected Value of a Function {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Definition 2: Expected Value of $g(X, Y)$

Let $g(X, Y)$ be a function of random variables $X$ and $Y$.

**For discrete random variables:**
$$E[g(X, Y)] = \sum_x \sum_y g(x, y) \cdot p(x, y)$$

**For continuous random variables:**
$$E[g(X, Y)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x, y) \cdot f(x, y) \, dx \, dy$$

**Special cases:**

- $E(X) = E[g(X, Y)]$ where $g(x, y) = x$

- $E(XY) = E[g(X, Y)]$ where $g(x, y) = xy$

- $E(X + Y) = E[g(X, Y)]$ where $g(x, y) = x + y$
:::

**Application:** Computing expected portfolio returns, option payoffs, and risk measures requires expected values of functions of multiple random variables [web:34][web:38].

## 🧮 Theorem: Linearity of Expectation

::: {.callout-important}
## Theorem 1: Linearity of Expectation

For any random variables $X$ and $Y$ (independent or not) and constants $a$, $b$, $c$:

$$\boxed{E(aX + bY + c) = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c}$$

**More generally, for any constants $a_i$ and random variables $X_i$:**

$$E\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i X_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i E(X_i)$$

**Key insight:** Linearity holds **whether or not** the variables are independent!

**Proof sketch:** Follows directly from the definition of expected value and properties of summation/integration.
:::

**Portfolio Application:** For a portfolio with weights $w_i$ and asset returns $R_i$:
$$E(R_P) = E\left(\sum w_i R_i\right) = \sum w_i E(R_i)$$

This is the foundation of portfolio expected return calculation [web:38][web:40].

## 📌 Example 2: Portfolio Expected Return {.smaller}

**Problem:** An investor creates a portfolio with 40% in Stock A (expected return 12%) and 60% in Stock B (expected return 8%). What is the expected portfolio return?

**Solution:**

Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the returns on stocks A and B. The portfolio return is:
$$R_P = 0.4 R_A + 0.6 R_B$$

Using linearity of expectation:
$$E(R_P) = E(0.4 R_A + 0.6 R_B) = 0.4 E(R_A) + 0.6 E(R_B)$$

$$E(R_P) = 0.4(12\%) + 0.6(8\%) = 4.8\% + 4.8\% = 9.6\%$$

$$\boxed{E(R_P) = 9.6\%}$$

**Key Point:** This calculation is valid **regardless of whether the stocks are independent or correlated**. Expected return depends only on individual expected returns and portfolio weights, not on the correlation structure.

**Note:** While expected return doesn't depend on correlation, **portfolio risk** (variance) critically depends on covariance, as we'll see later!

## 🧮 Theorem: Multiplication Rule for Independent Variables

::: {.callout-important}
## Theorem 2: Expected Value of Products

**If $X$ and $Y$ are independent**, then:

$$\boxed{E(XY) = E(X) \cdot E(Y)}$$

**Important:** This result requires independence. If $X$ and $Y$ are dependent, $E(XY) \neq E(X)E(Y)$ in general.

**Proof (discrete case):**

$$E(XY) = \sum_x \sum_y xy \cdot p(x, y)$$

By independence, $p(x, y) = p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y)$:

$$= \sum_x \sum_y xy \cdot p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y) = \sum_x x \cdot p_X(x) \sum_y y \cdot p_Y(y)$$

$$= E(X) \cdot E(Y) \quad \blacksquare$$
:::

**Financial Application:** If asset returns are independent, calculating cross-moments simplifies dramatically, though true independence is rare in practice [web:33].

## 📌 Example 3: Expected Product {.smaller}

**Problem:** Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with $E(X) = 3$, $E(Y) = 5$, $E(X^2) = 12$, and $E(Y^2) = 30$. Find $E(XY)$ and $E[(X+Y)^2]$.

**Solution (Part 1):**

Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, we can apply Theorem 2:
$$E(XY) = E(X) \cdot E(Y) = 3 \times 5 = 15$$

$$\boxed{E(XY) = 15}$$

**Solution (Part 2):**

Expand $(X + Y)^2$:
$$E[(X+Y)^2] = E[X^2 + 2XY + Y^2]$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$= E(X^2) + 2E(XY) + E(Y^2)$$

$$= 12 + 2(15) + 30 = 12 + 30 + 30 = 72$$

$$\boxed{E[(X+Y)^2] = 72}$$

## 🤝 Think-Pair-Share: Leverage and Independence {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
::: {.callout-note}
## 💭 Student Engagement Activity (5 minutes)

**Scenario:** A hedge fund uses 2:1 leverage, meaning for every $1 of equity, they borrow $1 to invest $2 total. The fund invests in two strategies: Strategy A (mean return 10%, std dev 15%) and Strategy B (mean return 8%, std dev 12%). Each strategy gets 50% of the $2 invested (i.e., $1 each). The cost of borrowing is 3% per year.

**Think (1 minute):** Work individually

- If the strategies are independent, what is the expected gross portfolio return (before borrowing costs)?

- What is the expected net return after paying 3% interest on the $1 borrowed?

- The return on equity (ROE) is net profit divided by the $1 equity invested. What is the expected ROE?

**Pair (2-3 minutes):** Discuss with a partner

- How would correlation between strategies affect the risk (not the expected return)?

- Is assuming independence realistic for hedge fund strategies operating in the same markets?

- What are the dangers of leverage when strategies are highly correlated?

**Share (1-2 minutes):** Class discussion

- Discuss how the 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the risks of assuming independence when strategies were actually correlated through hidden linkages

## 📖 Definition: Covariance {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Definition 3: Covariance

The **covariance** between random variables $X$ and $Y$ is:

$$\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]$$

where $\mu_X = E(X)$ and $\mu_Y = E(Y)$.

**Computational formula (easier for calculations):**

$$\boxed{\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)}$$

**Interpretation:**

- **Positive covariance**: $X$ and $Y$ tend to be simultaneously above or below their means—they move together

- **Negative covariance**: When $X$ is above its mean, $Y$ tends to be below its mean—they move in opposite directions

- **Zero covariance**: No linear relationship (uncorrelated)
:::

**Financial Meaning:** Covariance measures how asset returns move together—critical for portfolio risk management and diversification strategies [web:38][web:41].

## 🔍 Properties of Covariance

::: {.callout-tip}
## 📊 Key Properties

1. **Symmetry**: $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \text{Cov}(Y, X)$

2. **Variance as self-covariance**: $\text{Cov}(X, X) = \text{Var}(X)$

3. **Covariance with constant**: $\text{Cov}(X, c) = 0$ for any constant $c$

4. **Linearity**: $\text{Cov}(aX + b, Y) = a \cdot \text{Cov}(X, Y)$ for constants $a, b$

5. **Bilinearity**: $\text{Cov}(X + Y, Z) = \text{Cov}(X, Z) + \text{Cov}(Y, Z)$

6. **Independence implies zero covariance**: If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$
   - Proof: $E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)$ by independence, so $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) = 0$

7. **Zero covariance does NOT imply independence** (except for jointly normal variables)
:::

**Practical Note:** Covariance magnitude depends on the units of $X$ and $Y$, making it hard to interpret. Correlation (normalized covariance) solves this problem [web:41][web:42].

## 📌 Example 4: Computing Covariance {.smaller}

**Problem:** Consider the joint distribution from Example 1. Compute $\text{Cov}(X, Y)$.

**Solution:**

First, we need $E(X)$, $E(Y)$, and $E(XY)$.

**Step 1: Compute $E(X)$**

$$E(X) = (-5)(0.36) + (0)(0.24) + (5)(0.40) = -1.8 + 0 + 2.0 = 0.2$$

**Step 2: Compute $E(Y)$**

$$E(Y) = (-5)(0.24) + (0)(0.36) + (5)(0.40) = -1.2 + 0 + 2.0 = 0.8$$

**Step 3: Compute $E(XY)$**

$$E(XY) = \sum_x \sum_y xy \cdot p(x, y)$$

$$= (-5)(-5)(0.12) + (-5)(0)(0.18) + (-5)(5)(0.06)$$
$$+ (0)(-5)(0.08) + (0)(0)(0.12) + (0)(5)(0.04)$$
$$+ (5)(-5)(0.04) + (5)(0)(0.06) + (5)(5)(0.30)$$

## 📌 Example 4: Solution (continued) {.smaller}

Computing each term:
$$E(XY) = 25(0.12) + 0 + (-25)(0.06) + 0 + 0 + 0 + (-25)(0.04) + 0 + 25(0.30)$$

$$= 3.0 - 1.5 - 1.0 + 7.5 = 8.0$$

**Step 4: Apply the computational formula**

$$\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) = 8.0 - (0.2)(0.8)$$

$$= 8.0 - 0.16 = 7.84$$

$$\boxed{\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 7.84}$$

**Interpretation:** The positive covariance (7.84) indicates that Stocks $X$ and $Y$ tend to move together. When $X$ has a positive return, $Y$ is also likely to have a positive return. This positive covariance reduces diversification benefits—the stocks don't offset each other's risks as much as uncorrelated assets would.

**Note:** The magnitude (7.84) is hard to interpret directly because it depends on the units (percentage returns). Correlation normalizes this to a scale of [-1, 1].

## 🧮 Theorem: Variance of Sum of Random Variables

::: {.callout-important}
## Theorem 3: Variance Decomposition

For any random variables $X$ and $Y$:

$$\boxed{\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)}$$

**More generally, for constants $a$ and $b$:**

$$\text{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\text{Var}(X) + b^2\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab\text{Cov}(X, Y)$$

**Special case (independent variables):**

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$, so:

$$\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)$$

**Proof:** 
$$\text{Var}(X + Y) = E[(X + Y)^2] - [E(X + Y)]^2$$
$$= E(X^2 + 2XY + Y^2) - [E(X) + E(Y)]^2$$
$$= E(X^2) + 2E(XY) + E(Y^2) - E(X)^2 - 2E(X)E(Y) - E(Y)^2$$
$$= \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2[E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)] = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X,Y)$$
:::

## 📖 Portfolio Risk Formula

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Portfolio Variance (Two-Asset Case)

For a portfolio with weights $w_1$ and $w_2 = 1 - w_1$ invested in assets with returns $R_1$ and $R_2$:

$$R_P = w_1 R_1 + w_2 R_2$$

The portfolio variance is:

$$\boxed{\text{Var}(R_P) = w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2\text{Cov}(R_1, R_2)}$$

where $\sigma_i^2 = \text{Var}(R_i)$.

**Using correlation coefficient** $\rho_{12} = \text{Cov}(R_1, R_2)/(\sigma_1\sigma_2)$:

$$\text{Var}(R_P) = w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2\rho_{12}\sigma_1\sigma_2$$

**Key Insight:** Portfolio risk depends on:
1. Individual asset risks ($\sigma_1^2$, $\sigma_2^2$)
2. Portfolio weights ($w_1$, $w_2$)
3. **Covariance or correlation** ($\text{Cov}(R_1, R_2)$ or $\rho_{12}$)

Lower correlation → better diversification → lower portfolio risk [web:38][web:41]
:::

## 📌 Example 5: Portfolio Risk Calculation {.smaller}

**Problem:** An investor allocates 60% to Stock A and 40% to Stock B. Stock A has a standard deviation of 20%, Stock B has a standard deviation of 15%, and the correlation between them is 0.5. Calculate the portfolio standard deviation.

**Solution:**

Given: $w_A = 0.6$, $w_B = 0.4$, $\sigma_A = 0.20$, $\sigma_B = 0.15$, $\rho_{AB} = 0.5$

Using the portfolio variance formula:

$$\text{Var}(R_P) = w_A^2\sigma_A^2 + w_B^2\sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B\rho_{AB}\sigma_A\sigma_B$$

$$= (0.6)^2(0.20)^2 + (0.4)^2(0.15)^2 + 2(0.6)(0.4)(0.5)(0.20)(0.15)$$

$$= (0.36)(0.04) + (0.16)(0.0225) + 2(0.24)(0.5)(0.03)$$

$$= 0.0144 + 0.0036 + 0.0072 = 0.0252$$

Portfolio standard deviation:
$$\sigma_P = \sqrt{0.0252} = 0.1587 = 15.87\%$$

$$\boxed{\sigma_P = 15.87\%}$$

## 📌 Example 5: Interpretation {.smaller}

**Key Observations:**

1. **Diversification benefit**: The portfolio risk (15.87%) is **less than** the weighted average of individual risks:
   $$w_A\sigma_A + w_B\sigma_B = 0.6(20\%) + 0.4(15\%) = 12\% + 6\% = 18\%$$
   
   Portfolio risk of 15.87% < 18%, demonstrating diversification's power!

2. **Effect of correlation**:
   - If $\rho = 1$ (perfect positive correlation): $\sigma_P = 18.0\%$ (no diversification)
   - If $\rho = 0$ (uncorrelated): $\sigma_P = 14.42\%$ (better diversification)
   - If $\rho = -1$ (perfect negative correlation): $\sigma_P = 6.0\%$ (maximum diversification)

3. **Portfolio risk is always bounded**:
   $$|w_A\sigma_A - w_B\sigma_B| \leq \sigma_P \leq w_A\sigma_A + w_B\sigma_B$$

**Financial Lesson:** Diversification works best when assets have **low or negative correlations**. Even moderate positive correlation (0.5) still provides meaningful risk reduction [web:36][web:41].

## 💰 Case Study: Hedging Insights and Crisis Performance {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Key Findings

**Correlation Analysis:**

- **S&P 500 - Gold correlation** ≈ **0.05 to 0.15** (very low positive, nearly uncorrelated)

- During the **2020 COVID crisis** (Feb-Mar 2020), correlation turned slightly negative as gold rallied while stocks crashed

- Low correlation means gold movements are largely independent of stock market trends, providing genuine diversification

**Risk Reduction Benefits:**

- **100% S&P 500**: Daily volatility ≈ 1.2-1.5%

- **100% Gold**: Daily volatility ≈ 0.9-1.1%

- **Optimal mix (≈85% SPY, 15% GLD)**: Portfolio volatility ≈ 1.15-1.30%

- Even a small gold allocation (10-20%) **reduces portfolio risk** while sacrificing minimal expected return

**Hedging Effectiveness:**

1. **Crisis protection**: Gold tends to maintain or increase value during equity market stress (flight to safety)

2. **Low correlation benefit**: Unlike diversifying with another stock (which might have 0.7+ correlation), gold provides true diversification

3. **Optimal hedge ratio**: For this period, 10-20% in gold optimizes the risk-return tradeoff for equity-heavy portfolios

**Practical Application:** Many institutional investors hold 5-15% gold or gold-related assets as portfolio insurance, accepting slightly lower expected returns for meaningful risk reduction during market turmoil [web:36][web:41].

## 📝 Quiz #1: Independence Definition {.smaller .quiz-question}

If random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent, which statement must be true?

- [$P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P(X \in A) \cdot P(Y \in B)$ for all events $A$ and $B$]{.correct data-explanation="✅ Correct! This is the definition of independence - the joint probability factors into the product of marginal probabilities for all events."}
- $E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$
- $\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)$
- $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$

## 📝 Quiz #2: Linearity of Expectation {.smaller .quiz-question}

For random variables $X$ and $Y$ (not necessarily independent), which property always holds?

- [$E(3X + 2Y - 5) = 3E(X) + 2E(Y) - 5$]{.correct data-explanation="✅ Correct! Linearity of expectation holds for any random variables, regardless of independence or correlation."}
- $E(XY) = E(X) \cdot E(Y)$
- $E(X^2 + Y^2) = E(X)^2 + E(Y)^2$
- $\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)$

## 📝 Quiz #3: Covariance Interpretation {.smaller .quiz-question}

What does a negative covariance between two asset returns indicate?

- [The assets tend to move in opposite directions - when one rises, the other tends to fall]{.correct data-explanation="✅ Correct! Negative covariance means the variables have an inverse relationship, providing valuable diversification for a portfolio."}
- The assets are independent
- The assets have negative expected returns
- The portfolio of the two assets has negative expected return

## 📝 Quiz #4: Portfolio Variance {.smaller .quiz-question}

For a portfolio with 50% in Asset A and 50% in Asset B, if both assets have variance 0.04 and covariance 0.01, what is the portfolio variance?

- [0.03]{.correct data-explanation="✅ Correct! Var(Rp) = 0.5² × 0.04 + 0.5² × 0.04 + 2 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.01 = 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.03"}
- 0.04
- 0.05
- 0.02

## 📝 Quiz #5: Independence and Covariance {.smaller .quiz-question}

If $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$, which statement is true?

- [X and Y may or may not be independent - zero covariance does not imply independence]{.correct data-explanation="✅ Correct! Zero covariance means uncorrelated, but independence is a stronger condition. They are equivalent only for jointly normal variables."}
- $X$ and $Y$ must be independent
- $E(XY) \neq E(X)E(Y)$
- $\text{Var}(X + Y) > \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)$

## 📝 Summary {.smaller}

::: {.summary-box}
**✅ Key Takeaways**

- **Independence** means $p(x,y) = p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y)$ or equivalently $E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)$, implying knowledge of one variable provides no information about the other—rare but valuable in finance for maximum diversification [web:33]

- **Linearity of expectation** $E(aX + bY + c) = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c$ holds for ANY random variables (independent or not), making portfolio expected return calculations straightforward regardless of asset correlations

- **Covariance** $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)$ measures the direction and strength of linear association between variables, with positive values indicating co-movement and negative values indicating inverse movement—critical for portfolio construction [web:38][web:41]

- **Portfolio variance formula** $\text{Var}(w_1R_1 + w_2R_2) = w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2\text{Cov}(R_1,R_2)$ shows that portfolio risk depends critically on covariance, not just individual asset risks—the foundation of modern portfolio theory

- **Diversification benefit** arises from imperfect correlation: assets with correlation less than 1 provide risk reduction, with maximum benefit at correlation -1 (perfect hedge), demonstrating why portfolio construction requires understanding joint distributions, not just marginals [web:36][web:42]

## 📚 Practice Problems {.smaller}

::: {.callout-tip}
## 📝 Homework Problems

**Problem 1 (Independence Test)**: Two assets have joint pmf: $p(1,1) = 0.3$, $p(1,2) = 0.2$, $p(2,1) = 0.15$, $p(2,2) = 0.35$ where values are {1, 2}. (a) Find the marginal distributions; (b) Test whether the assets are independent; (c) Compute $E(XY)$; (d) Would you expect diversification benefits?

**Problem 2 (Expected Values)**: For independent random variables with $E(X) = 5$, $E(Y) = 3$, $\text{Var}(X) = 4$, $\text{Var}(Y) = 9$, find: (a) $E(2X - 3Y + 7)$; (b) $E(XY)$; (c) $\text{Var}(2X - 3Y)$; (d) $E[(X-Y)^2]$.

**Problem 3 (Covariance from Data)**: Given returns data: $(X, Y)$ pairs are $(0.05, 0.03)$, $(0.02, 0.04)$, $(-0.01, 0.01)$, $(0.03, -0.02)$, $(0.01, 0.02)$ with equal probability 0.2 each. Find: (a) $E(X)$ and $E(Y)$; (b) $E(XY)$; (c) $\text{Cov}(X,Y)$; (d) Interpret the sign of the covariance.

**Problem 4 (Portfolio Optimization)**: An investor allocates weight $w$ to stocks ($\sigma_S = 25\%$, $\mu_S = 12\%$) and $(1-w)$ to bonds ($\sigma_B = 8\%$, $\mu_B = 5\%$) with correlation $\rho = 0.2$. Find: (a) Expected portfolio return as function of $w$; (b) Portfolio variance formula; (c) The value of $w$ minimizing variance; (d) The minimum achievable standard deviation; (e) Compare risk to 100% stocks.

## 💬 Open Discussion (5 minutes)

**Key Topics for Discussion:**

- Why is statistical independence so rare in financial markets, and what hidden factors create dependencies between seemingly unrelated assets?

- How did the 2008 financial crisis demonstrate the danger of assuming independence when assets were actually correlated through complex linkages (e.g., CDOs, credit default swaps)?

- What is the difference between zero covariance (uncorrelated) and independence, and why does this distinction matter for non-linear derivatives like options?

- How do portfolio managers use correlation forecasts in practice, and what are the challenges when correlations change dramatically during market stress (correlation breakdownkdown)?
