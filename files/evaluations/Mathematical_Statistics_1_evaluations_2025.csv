"Would you recommend the course to other students? Why/why not?","Yes . İt is by far the best math course","Yes.","Overall i would, but because there were some issues, students may experience stress. ","yes i will,  very usefull in real life",,,"Of course, Samir muellim is one hell of a smart guy and whenever I mailed him he always explained the questions to me. He is probably the kindest instructor at the whole ADA!!","Yes, the instructor explained all topics very well and his methods are useful for all students ",,"Yes, but personally I didn’t understand the explanation of teacher. I was doing self study with the help of you tube videos which also were in English. Why I mentioned that they were in English, because teacher usually says that we don’t understand hip because we don’t know English well. However, I think his explanation methodos are very confusing.","yes","Yes","Yes l would as teacher explains the relevant information ","The course is complex and in my opinion topics are very difficult to comprehend ","Yes",,"Yes because it's the best in explaining statistical analysis and application in real world ","Yes, because instructor teaches it in a way that lectures become interesting","Yes, it is great",,,"Yes, as this instructor is the best among others","Yes. The material is in an understandable format, and the concepts are easy to grasp.","Yes. Although the course is difficult, the teacher makes it interesting ",,,"Yes. Since we apply real world examples into lectures ",,,,"Yes. It’s very interesting material to learn, I highly recommend.","Yes",,"The instructor is highly knowledgable, guiding via distinct insights and real life examples.","Yes. Dr. Samir Orujov explanations were clear and understandable ","Yes it is very good",,"Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It is very interesting and useful course. Also, I would like mention that this course becomes more interesting for me thank to our instructor. He  taught us that how we can use this information in our real life.",,"Yes I definitely will ","To do self study, do hws, learn by heart, because you will not get higher grade without learning by heart. I guess it is unfair, in midterm, i tried to do all questions with using my brain, but the time was not enough. That's why, I got lower, but students who know less than me, got high grade with just learning hw questions by heart 😮‍💨💔","Sure","Yes,  great instructor",,,"yes. ","Yes, it is very crucial course to develop statistical foundation.","Yes. Because the course is interesting",,"Absolutely. To be quite honest Prof Samir is one of the few instructors I've met whom genuinely care about his students. In the past 2 years I've been studying for my bachelors degree, there have been only two classes that interested me solely because the instructor made it that way. His classes are probably the only part of the day I actually enjoy learning. Not only that, but prof. Samir sees how hard I work for this course. Instructors hardly ever acknowledge your efforts, so it is pretty nice when someone, especially an expert, appriciates your honest work. ","sure, statistics is essential thing to know at least in daily life ","Yes, it is very useful","Yes, because the methodology applied by the instructor in terms of teaching was interactive and very useful ",,"Yes i would, because it would help us in future a lot ","yes, because it is very useful in real world fields",,,"Yes, I would. Because despite the challenges of the subject itself the teacher helps a lot which eases the stress of the subject. Just by attending the classes taking notes and doing homeworks I get decent grades and I’ve never read the book. So the classes are super helpful!","Yes, it was experience.",,"Excellent and caring instructor, interesting topics that you can find real life examples.",,,"Yes ı would ","Of course I will. 100%.","I would, because the instructor tries to be helpful and assist students. ",,,"Yes","Yes,because the course is interesting.","yes","Mr Samir is able to explain complex materials, theorems and concepts in a very easy and intuitive way. You UNDERSTAND statistics in this course, not memorize.","Yes ","I recommend because they cannot take Math STAT 2 witout MATH STAT 1"
