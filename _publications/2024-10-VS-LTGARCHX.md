This paper presents the VS-LTGARCHX methodology, a significant advancement in time series modeling that addresses the limitations of traditional GARCH models. The research demonstrates improved forecasting accuracy and volatility estimation in financial time series data.

**Abstract**: This study introduces the VS-LTGARCHX (Variable Selection Long-Term Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity with Exogenous variables) model, which enhances traditional time series analysis by incorporating advanced variable selection techniques and long-term memory components.

**Key Contributions**:
- Novel integration of variable selection methods with GARCH frameworks
- Improved forecasting performance for financial time series
- Comprehensive empirical validation using real-world datasets
